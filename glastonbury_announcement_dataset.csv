Edit - she just texted, she's taking me! I just had to promise to let her film me so I can be teased in the family groupchat. Fine!",149,2024-03-14 10:11:47,114.21666666666667,309

6,kut2qff,this is INSANE?! i think they're the first k-pop act to ever play at glasto AND on the pyramid stage!!! im so proud of them😭,56,2024-03-14 08:24:42,7.133333333333334,124
7,kutylqx,I really think they are performing mainly because it’s a very prestigious event and also they will be the first K-pop group to do so. Also unlike other festivals no matter who performs the crowd usually is drunk out of their mind and cheer for everyone. I’m sure Hybe/Pledis are aware of the fact that majority of their fans will not be able to buy tickets. The good news is that this is live telecasted on BBC and they do make a big deal about viewership.,24,2024-03-14 13:30:16,312.7,456

15,kut6bw6,"i read the notification and then i read it again and honestly this still hasn’t sunk in

getting tickets at this stage is probably close to impossible (i think they sold out months ago?) but how exciting for any carats who already happen to be going. how exciting in general! seventeen at glastonbury! 

the chances of a european tour felt so low, but with the announcements of the past couple of days i am feeling really hopeful. too hopeful? maybe. let’s see what the next few weeks bring",16,2024-03-14 09:10:52,53.3,490
16,kuu6mzt,"I've never been to Glastonbury before but I have relatives who attend every year, and let me tell you: this will certainly be an ***experience*** for SVT :'D

I understand the reasoning behind Hybe and Pledis deciding on this event. It's definitely news worthy. Even BBC is reporting it, claiming SVT as the first kpop group to get the main stage. It's huge PR, and a great move to show their domain internationally. BUT. All tickets sold out in November, and chances of many carats being able to attend is...... low. Like real low. The audience will be very, ehm, *unusual* compared to what they're used to, and I'm glad they have such strong performing and entertaining qualities because otherwise the first impression could go wrong in so many ways. I hope they'll have lot of fun and take it as easy as they did with the Unesco event, because they'll definitely need to ADAPT for this one.",15,2024-03-14 14:20:32,362.96666666666664,893
17,kut7017,"Though I am extremely happy that they would be the first k-pop group to perform at Glatso's main stage, I am kinda worried too coz little to no carats will be there and they will have to perform in front of the locals or worse, a dead crowd. I am trying to look at the brighter side of things though so maybe this will help them get more exposure, meet and network with other artists and increase their fanbase in the UK.",24,2024-03-14 09:19:12,61.63333333333333,421

38,kutp88w,"Sigh. I'm very happy for svt because this is an amazing opportunity for them and I'm very excited for the carats who do get to see them, but I also have my doubts about this. I worry that this is a double whammy combo of Glasto trying to stay relevant by booking kpop artists (which may go well or may backfire depending on how the crowd responds) and Hybe refusing to let their artists book actual seated venue tour dates in Europe (because they're salty that they can't do dynamic pricing in a continent with actual consumer protection laws) I'm reserving judgement, maybe these two festival dates are bookends for a European tour, let's hold out hope that they are! But I can't help but have a bad feeling that Glasto, while prestigious, is firmly the territory of mud drenched rahs on ket and that the most enthusiastic audience svt will get will be the carats who couldn't access or afford tickets watching for free on the BBC iplayer stream.",4,2024-03-14 12:22:42,245.13333333333333,947

40,kuta7rx,"Not to repeat the exact same sentiment as everyone else but I'm so sad UK Carats have been waiting so long and the first time SVT come to perform here it's at a SOLD OUT festival that all the normies are saying has the worst lineup ever like 😭😭 I just KNOW The European carats would absolutely turn up for this if we got a chance to buy the tickets??? I feel like they're gonna go and the non carat crowd won't appreciate them at all. I know they've been known to hype up a dead crowd but like...the k-pop haters will not be converted I fear

My only wish is for a tour!

BUT, svt are entertainers. A good list of songs specifically chosen for the Glasto, and some emphasis in entertaining the audience, and I believe they'll do miracles <3 

Whatever will happen, I believe it'll be an experience for them different from anything they've ever done... and my hope too is that someone will warn them before going, so that they'll come prepared and ready because the worst thing that could happen is for them or Pledis to completely not understand what Glastonbury is, and risking making a fool out of them.

They want a big name event, scrap another news worthy record for SVT, and affirm the group internationally, possibly gaining new fans and audience by generating curiosity and putting on a show to a completely different kind of ppl.

Glastonbury is arguably the most famous festival in the world? And IS the largest greenfield music and performing arts festival in the world. Everyone (including small acts on small stages) performs to a general festival crowd there, but it’s a 210,000 capacity event so obviously there will also be some carats in attendance.

Choosing Glastonbury probably come with zero expectation of seeing an ocean of carat bongs, but a whole lotta other reasonings more business related

Instead, I definitely feel like Lollapalooza fits this speculation way more, and that will be the one showing the demand for sure. I hope to see a massive crown of carats there in support ❤️",7,2024-03-14 14:40:35,383.01666666666665,598

What you saw 5+ Glastos or a decade ago doesn't matter, because you've never seen a K-Pop group on the Pyramid in the first place. The fact there is one now is a sign of where things are heading.

Why did we get no news back when tickets went on sale?

I don't think Hybe realises that UK crowds aren't entirely welcoming to music they don't like or is different.. you just have to see any Western band perform with a support to see how people actively opt to miss the support because they don't like them meaning the crowd is emptier than when the main act is on.

Seventeen fans aren't kids. They are mostly likely millennials or older gen-z types. Just in this sub alone there's a few people fretting about potentially having to choose between The National and Seventeen sets. Yeah, those music listeners exist. I for one love bands like The National who've I've seen several times during Boxer era and also appreciate Seventeen and kpop.

Also, Seventeen has a lot of natural musicality that is suited to this festival. That's pretty rare in kpop groups frankly. I think they booked this festival for exposure rather than to reach already converted fans. It's a risk, but isn't this the kind of thing fans always want kpop companies to do for their groups?",31,2024-03-14 10:27:29,132.81666666666666,840

For all the other acts though, I don’t think there’s really ever any problems, it’s always super varied. The pyramid stage in the day… most people are just drinking and chilling, sat on the hill, kids running about (I’m imagining it’s sunny in this scenario 🙏) . I think it’ll be a great experience for Seventeen! They know what they’re getting into, they’ll know the crowd won’t be full of kpop fans, but it will be full of people wanting to have a good time.
