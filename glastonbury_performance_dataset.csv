0,laosqhc,"yes, that's how i felt from watching them through the screen! they seemed completely prepared and knew just how to rile up the crowd. And they chose what i thought was the perfect setlist for Glastonbury. The entire performance was pretty perfect to me, from pacing to of course, their artistry. 

This just shows that they are master performers. And I'm so proud of them for bravely bringing kpop there. Thank you for sharing your experience!!",293,2024-06-28 15:57:48,4.833333333333333,444
1,laot54t,"Thank you so much for the review!!! 

>Although it’s day one of Glastonbury, out of the three I’ve been to, this performance was one of the best. And felt important.

This brought me chills. I couldn't see the full thing I hope I'll find a recording of the stream somewhere but I am only seeing positive comments everywhere and it's making me so happy",118,2024-06-28 16:00:11,7.216666666666667,351
2,laouvnq,"Thank you so much for the review! I'm glad the performance was as enjoyable for the live audience as it seemed on screen. Honestly i wasn't expecting the public to be very responsive since there were only few carats in attendance, but seeing the vids i'm glad to see i was proven wrong! Enjoy the rest of the festival 😄",87,2024-06-28 16:10:03,17.083333333333332,319
3,laouwad,"Definitely agree that they chose well for their festival setlist – pretty much all the songs I hoped they'd perform were included (apart from Super). They were absolutely fantastic at interacting with a mostly non-carat crowd and hyping them up, it really shows the true calibre of their performancs skills. I'm so proud of them! 🥹",82,2024-06-28 16:10:09,17.183333333333334,331
4,lapq6cz,"I really liked how they gave a bite sized taste of what their usual concerts are like, especially with never ending Aju Nice. 

Out of everything, I’m somehow very surprised that they decided to end off with Aju Nice and even faked their ending song like at their concerts. (Im not gatekeeping but Im just surprised since it’s mainly because it’s kind of an inside joke with Carats). 

Seungkwan even interacted with the crowd, which was what he always does at their concerts. And he specifically chose a young girl and an older lady instead of someone who’s visibly a fan (there were two beside the lady), which was very interesting and smart considering how they’re attempting to appeal to the masses. 

The crowd definitely looked like they warmed up to them by the end. Their strategy (funny to use this word on a performance), like you said, less talking, focusing on the chantable parts, was very smart.

I also liked how Seungkwan acknowledged that they have many members. And they proceeded to prove how they can properly utilise all 13 members on stage, especially with their performance units, and spreading on stage from one end to another to interact with the audience.

Their song choices are also good, choosing more rock-ish or band-ish songs like Rock With You, 2 Minus 1, Cheers to Youth, SOS, Headliner. 

Overall, I think Seventeen planned really well for this.",59,2024-06-28 19:03:36,190.63333333333333,1380

6,laouj8o,"I thought the audience engagement was much better than expected, considering they might not have performed that often at a mixed festival let alone somewhere as global and diverse sound wise as Glastonbury festival.

For whatever reason I didn’t expect the unit songs to be performed, but that was a pleasant surprise. I would have hoped for more logistic effort from either the crew or festival operation in getting the messages of the lyrics across, something as simple as putting things on the screen for non-Korean and new fans to follow. 

But this is a great first Glasto experience for the boys, I’m really hoping they actually get to stick around and enjoy the music, mingling with other artists and have a good time rather than leaving for the airport right away!",110,2024-06-28 16:08:08,15.166666666666666,772
7,lapz32w,"I was front row and so very pleased. I found some other carats to speak with as well. I wasn’t expecting 2 minus 1 but it was a pleasant surprise. Thought they would’ve done Spell - it’s the UK, that style of music is big here. Loved woozi starting maestro on the piano and super thankful we got several aju nices in! Fan highlight was getting a horange back from Hoshi, DK smiling at me singing (screaming?! 😅) Korean lyrics at him, and Boo coming down the stage to greet us. We could see them before they came on stage and all got excited then we were silent waiting to breathe for them to come out it was great anticipation. Minghao came and had a boogie to our section as well which was a BIG vibe. Impossible to be impressed by only one of them, they were all amazing 🤩",48,2024-06-28 19:54:13,241.25,774

First, welcome to the diamond life!!

Second, if you randomly happened to catch SVT's set because you were too buzzed on something and just wanted to vibe, thank you for spending that quality time enjoying their set, and I hope you will also try their music when you're completely sober and find out that it's still really great music LOL",27,2024-06-28 18:48:47,175.81666666666666,434

21,laphjoa,I need y’all to stop making me cry. That’s all I‘ve been doing today. Seeing Seventeen growing over the last 7 years has been so emotional for me and so rewarding. They keep going even now and today was such a beautiful way of showing that.,24,2024-06-28 18:15:43,142.75,240
22,lappi6p,"I was so happy to watch the performance through the live stream. I unexpectedly cried during their set as I felt their passion for performing through the screen. They were magnetic and charming, they enchanted the crowd. I’m so jealous of the people who got to watch them live, and at the same time, I am proud that more people get to know Seventeen more. Seventeen, you deserve the world! 🫶🏻",21,2024-06-28 18:59:49,186.85,392

This caption is hilarious though haha. Not sure what expletives Seventeen have in their music.

They did great and seemed to enjoy the festival stage. Seungkwan really stood out in encouraging the crowd, not a carat but he does this in their concerts? So glad they could be themselves and I liked their casual outfits too.

Great planning on the set list to showcase the units too because I guess of military enlistment? It won't seem strange to new international fans going forwards.

Also they're so attractive, all of them, especially without the K whitewash filter!!! Hope they get to enjoy some of the other artists' performances and festival vibe.",18,2024-06-28 22:25:03,392.0833333333333,773

28,lasanku,"The 1 hour set captured Seventeen's essence.

They begin the set with the one and only, the backbone of their discography, the Maestro himself.

Then have a section to show off you are K-Pop's performance powerhouse.

Then you hint at having some English singles and English-speaking members.

Then you show the unit system.

Then you show the hype building music, such as Clap (which is, in my opinion, a quintessential SVT track) and HOT. Hook, line, and sinker.

Then you end the set with Headliner and God of Music after charming the crowd, presenting Seventeen to the World.

And it's not Seventeen without the queen of their discography, the one that haunts Woozi and the members themselves, and its numerous replays. Although toned down, they (Mingyu and Seungkwan) successfully interacted with the audience by descending to the ground. Wish they could have done DK-Seungkwan vocal battle, but it was nothing less than perfect.",13,2024-06-29 05:07:31,794.55,934

31,laqcpz2,"I sat and watched it at home on iplayer and the scream I let out when idubily started 😭 was sat here jealous that the locals got to see it live before me (same with the neverending Aju Nice). I was actually pretty shocked at the set list like no Super? But I think what they chose was perfect, like the English songs and stuff that had easily chantable lyrics as well as them being more rock-ish in vibes (with glasto originally having rock routes). Overall I think it was the perfect introduction of them to the uk and I hope that carats start to take over (also their live vocals are insane, the skill and talent from them is crazy)",11,2024-06-28 21:13:14,320.26666666666665,634
32,lashqjr,"Casual Seventeen fan here, but hats off for a phenomenal performance! They were so so impressive. Sounded great and the way they are in constant motion on stage to give every member their moment in front or at center ... amazing. So many moving parts yet they make it look effortless. I know they're veterans but still, they had to have put in a lot of practice time for that one hour show. Special shoutout to Woozi because Seventeen's discography is so varied and strong, and he's a talented singer and dancer as well. And Hoshi and Seungkwan did a great job interacting with the crowd. Honestly every member brings something special to the team. Quick question: did something happen to Mingyu's pants, lol?  It looked like they might have ripped in front during GOM because he was draping a towel in front during Aju Nice. Anyway, congrats to Seventeen and their fans.

Because that IS one of the staples of a Seventeen performance and that would be a VERY easy way to highlight the differences between them and literally every other act that would perform there.

It’s not like they’re launching scoups or woozi into the air like 손오공 😜 and getting/borrowing a ballet barre isn’t impossible either. I could’ve asked the theatre and circus field here to spot them 🤣 

It was weird as someone that knows the choreo watching Maestro be performed without the backup dancers for SC and JH conducting to them on the sides. And the cool silver arms 😋 but it still worked.

IMO they were meant to be highlighting their dance skills and the Spell or Lilili Yabbay choreo do that much better.

Before Glasto I had put “Clap” on my wish list to hear live and when I heard them start the intro the scream I let out is embarrassing 😭

But, seriously they hyped the crowd so well and sang fantastically as expected. It’s my first time seeing them after waiting for a concert for years and they absolutely delivered and beyond. Honestly as soon as they were leaving the stage I was already missing them. I hope Europe will be able to get proper tour stops soon because 1 hour simply is not enough 🥺It’s a bit of a shame they weren’t able to stay at Glastonbury longer and enjoy more of the festival which would have been fun for them.

Also I know a big concern was there’d be no carats in the crowd but there were actually quite a few! Way more than I expected and we were all going crazy for them, singing along etc. There were several flags and signs and light sticks! So I hope that was also a pleasant surprise for Svt! Even though if it was all a complete non carat audience they would still have rocked it I’m sure!!",71,2024-06-29 08:40:01,714.6833333333333,1205

110,las438t,"Two things I was sure of before Seventeen performed at Glastonbury: 1) that Seventeen would always give their best at every performance, and 2) that Seventeen's best is some of the very best that kpop has to give. So proud to have seen them prove me right once again – watching them represent kpop for the first time in Glastonbury history, in front of an audience who doesn't know them or their music genre, and being able to hype them up so much regardless, really makes me appreciate just why I became a fan in the first place. 🥹 It must be so daunting to do something like that, even for seasoned performers, and it could have been just as easy or justifiable to not even attend Glastonbury when their fanbase is already so big now, so I really admire their bravery in even deciding to do this stage. They rose to the challenge perfectly, and it really goes to show just how dedicated and passionate they still are about sharing and performing their music together, even after so many years. 🩷🩵",53,2024-06-29 04:12:41,447.35,998

Glastonbury attracts like 140,000 audience a year and the whole site itself is MASSIVE. People are likely scattered across different stages and even non-music activities like cinema, comedy, litrature tents! Hell, people have massage appointments booked at this point in wellbeing tents! 

I’m proud of what the boys did today! So so pleased to see clearly non-fans and probably some of the most unlikely demographic of Kpop fans stick around during the whole set and actually enjoy themselves.

206,laoupqh,"Not all performances have to be for Carats. Every artist who wants to be successful and relevant in the mainstream has to promote beyond their comfort zones in order to get there. Glastonbury is one of the most famous music festivals in the Western sphere, it draws world-famous acts as headliners and for many smaller acts it's a dream to even make it onto a Glasto stage. Yeah Seventeen aren't headliners here, but they get the big distinction of being the first K-act to perform at a festival as famous as Glastonbury. That's big for getting your name out there to casuals, especially outside of the K-pop market.

EDIT to add: Blackpink wasn't a headliner during their Coachella debut either, but look what happened to their popularity after their performances there. As long as their live vocals hold up well, which Western music listeners value significantly (sorry to Le Sserafim but those live sounds at Coachella were... not great) this could be a major win for Seventeen.",50,2024-06-28 16:09:08,71.68333333333334,981

208,laor656,Honestly I don't think it matters if they're performing to few fans.

I'm not a particular Seventeen fan, just been on the edge of Kpop but I'm watching their performance today for the first time!


What is often a shame about Pyramid performers at Glasto is the people at the front are often not interested at all and just reserving the spot for the headliners later on.... so the crowd vibes get killed by people who just talk over the performances and don't want to be there!

I regularly rant on this topic, that there is a big gap in the UK market for Kpop and I don't just mean touring, but to try and genuinely build a profile in the UK to gain promotional/television work etc. It doesn't necessarily need to be an already huge act to do it either, just someone willing to visit regularly and build up that connection. For example, WayV would be ideal, because most members speak excellent English and Yangyang is already familiar with the country, but quite a few other acts probably fit that category. 

Back to Seventeen, I'm delighted their set went down well. Unlike a suspiciously high number of posters on Kpop subs, I genuinely think Kpop produces excellent music and has some generationally talented performers, so anything that breaks them through to a wider audience.",15,2024-06-29 02:42:27,481.06666666666666,1066

382,laozrpg,"Just logged in to my account to see if anyone had written a post about it and if not, I was going to write one myself. I am feeling a myriad of emotions rn. UK is a place where k-pop market is smaller as compared to many other countries of the world, and performing at Glasto on top of that, which is not only attended but was also live-streamed in its entirety this time across UK, had me feeling all kinds of nerves for them. SVT was not only presenting themselves infront of a crowd of locals, but also representing k-pop. Their performance could have possibly determined if Glasto organisers will invite k-pop groups in the coming years. So yes, the stakes felt pretty high. But as they performed and I saw a happy audience, chanting, hyping them up, putting their hands up in the air for them, I started feeling emotional. Emotional of the history they were making, emotional of how non-fans were also praising their hard-work and music. Seungkwan being hugged by a giddy aunt, Mingyu being waved to and fist-bumped by male audience and the crowd going crazy during aju nice, everything felt like a dream to witness.

  
As soon as their set ended, I logged in to my Twitter account and all I came across was praises from the people who watched their set live or on TV. Seungcheol once said that SVT will make sure that Carats are never ashamed of calling themselves their fans and they stand by those words with every performance.

391,laqep01,"Copying my comment from the SVT sub!

I really liked how they gave a bite sized taste of what their usual concerts are like, especially with never ending Aju Nice.

Out of everything, I’m somehow very surprised that they decided to end off with Aju Nice and even faked their ending song like at their concerts. (Im not gatekeeping but Im just surprised since it’s mainly because it’s kind of an inside joke with Carats).

Seungkwan even interacted with the crowd, which was what he always does at their concerts. And he specifically chose a young girl and an older lady instead of someone who’s visibly a fan (there were two beside the lady), which was very interesting and smart considering how they’re attempting to appeal to the masses.

The crowd definitely looked like they warmed up to them by the end. Their strategy (funny to use this word on a performance) where there were less talking, focusing on the chantable parts, was very smart.

I also liked how Seungkwan acknowledged that they have many members. And they proceeded to prove how they can properly utilise all 13 members on stage, especially with their performance units, and spreading on stage from one end to another to interact with the audience.

Their song choices are also good, choosing more rock-ish or band-ish songs like Rock With You, 2 Minus 1, Cheers to Youth, SOS, Headliner.

Overall, I think Seventeen planned really well for this.",44,2024-06-28 21:24:41,314.31666666666666,1415
392,lapc1sa,"Honestly, I was really nervous for them earlier too. Because what if they don’t have a good experience or a have a good crowd? I felt like a mother worrying for her child coming out of their comfort zone. 

However, I read a tweet saying that all who goes to Glastonbury Festival come for the music. It relieved me a bit. And after watching it live, aside from SVT and their performance, I really love how the crowd welcomed them and how they responded to SVT.

Their setlist is well thought of, because they chose the songs that can really get everyone into it. I am sooooo touched about their reactions.

I am filled with soooooo much pride for SEVENTEEN. They’re always proving to Carats that we will never ever be ashamed to be fans of SEVENTEEN.

And I was really proud of their performance. To win over an audience that isn't your fanbase and majority isn't familiar with Korean or K-pop is great! They seemed to have fun and so did the crowd. 

I've seen multiple tweets from rock fan men who were there calling them cool lads. Which is honestly the highest complement you're gonna get from a man in the UK.

And I know they got a lot of media coverage from this that has opened them up to much wider name recognition. 

For example, my mum read a BBC article about them being the first Kpop band at Glastonbury and found it interesting enough to watch them today. She messaged me to say 'the other Korean men you like are on BBC right now and they are very handsome' ☠️.",57,2024-06-28 22:55:44,405.3666666666667,901

474,lasjagn,"I think this sort of argument though it may seem well-meaning on its face shows a kind of dehumanization. For example, Judy Garland was abused as a child by multiple agents/directors/studios, and we can talk in detail about that, but no one would use that to justify blacklisting the actual work that she did. She was taken advantage of, but she's still respected as an actress and singer. Likewise Kesha was in an extremely exploitative contract with an actual rapist, but her songs and performances still have value. 

Your argument only makes sense if you do not see any of these performers actual humans creating art, but victims who have no agency. 

You might be able to make this sort of argument about current trainees who are too young to give informed consent, but at this moment you're talking about men in their late 20s who have a nearly 10 year career. by dismissing them with this justification you are. being.
